Satellite Conjunction Analysis and Collision Risk Prediction
This project analyzes satellite conjunction data (CDM) and predicts potential collision risks using Python libraries such as Skyfield, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Plotly.

Project Overview
The increasing number of satellites in orbit raises concerns about space debris and potential collisions. This project aims to provide insights into satellite conjunction events and develop a model to predict collision risk based on available data.

Features
Loading and processing satellite TLE (Two-Line Element) data using Skyfield.
Analyzing Conjunction Data Messages (CDM) to identify close approaches between satellites.
Calculating satellite positions and distances at the Time of Closest Approach (TCA).
Developing a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict collision risk.
Visualizing conjunction data and predicted risks.
Saving and loading the trained collision risk prediction model.
Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed. You can then install the required libraries using pip:
